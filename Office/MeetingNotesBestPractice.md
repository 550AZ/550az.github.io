# Meeting Notes Best Practice

## Why

Meeting note is a best venue to log key decisions, key discussion points and follow-up actions. It is also a powerful venue to push actions execution.

* We always need a meeting note unless the meeting is information sharing only without any following up actions
* Send the meeting note within the same day

 

## What

* **Subject with date** - Clear subject with date to push follow up actions
* **Attendees** - who attended the meeting 
* **Document presented** - slides, spec, design, ect
* **Key takeaways** - high level summary for review and also for who didnâ€™t join the meeting the key messages they need to know 
* **Action items** - things to follow up by who, ideally call out by when
* **Details** - (optional) detailed info for those want to know more 

 

## How

- Dictation is the basic skill (practise your listening, speaking and writing)

- A simple note template with above sections
- Listen and record recap carefully. It happens at end of a discussion
- Collate the note and send it out after the meeting as soon as possible. You may forget some information when time passed
- Assign someone other than the presenter to take notes. The presenter can focus on the key decisions and follow up actions
