# Document

Documents are core to our work. Documents are long-living and should be considered the primary ways to communicate, share agreements and disagreements, and building upon each other's knowledge.

* Writing documents helps us build clarity in our thinking. Keep documents concise and clear, ideally no more than 2 pages.
* Documents make us more inclusive and democratic. Input is not limited to those "in the room". Everyone is encouraged to comment. 
* Documents cut down on context setting when used as a pre-read and enable author call out specific points to discuss. 
* Documents capture our collective knowledge and current status. They are sharable and accessible across teams. 

When individuals and teams need to accelerate the resolution of an issue, our default is that we channel the energy into a short document, and a meeting about document. The document frames the decision, contains a recommendation, leaves room for an alternative, and provides a way to bring leaders or outside stakeholder into help resolve the disagreement and make the decision.
